# Measurement tools for CosmoScout VR

A CosmoScout VR plugin with several tools for terrain measurements. For example, it supports the measurement of distances, height profiles, volumes or areas. The plugin is built as part of CosmoScout's build process. See the [main repository](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr) for instructions.

This is a default plugin of CosmoScout VR. Hence, any **issues should be reported to the [main issue tracker](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/issues)**. There you can add a label indicating which plugins are affected.

* **Location Flag:** Displays the geographic coordinates and the address of the selected point as accurately as possible.
* **Landing Ellipse:** Puts an ellipse on the body, which is controllable by the center and two points. The center also has a Location Flag.
* **Path Measurement:** Enables the user to place a piecewise linear path on the surface of a body. Information about distance and elevation along the path will be shown.
* **Dip & Strike:** Used to measure the orientation of a surface feature. The dip shows the angle/steepness and the strike the orientation of the surface feature.
* **Polygon:** Measures the area and volume of an arbitrary polygon on surface with a Delaunay-mesh.

## Configuration

This plugin can be enabled with the following configuration in your `settings.json`.
The given values present some good starting values for your customization, however all are optional:

```javascript
{
  ...
  "plugins": {
    ...
    "csp-measurement-tools": {
      "polygonHeightDiff": 1.002, // Maximum allowed relative height difference along an edged
      "polygonMaxAttempt": 5,     // Maximum mesh refinement operations
      "polygonMaxPoints": 1000,   // Maximum number of vertices in the generated mesh
      "polygonSleekness": 15      // Minium allowed triangle corner angle
      "ellipseSamples": 360       // Number of elevation samples taken along the ellipse
      "pathSamples": 256          // Number of elevation samples taken between path control points
      "dipStrikes": []            // An array of currently active dip & Strike tools.
      "ellipses": []              // An array of currently active ellipse tools.
      "flags": []                 // An array of currently active flag tools.
      "paths": []                 // An array of currently active path tools.
      "polygons": []              // An array of currently active polygon tools.
    }
  }
}
```

**More in-depth information and some tutorials will be provided soon.**
